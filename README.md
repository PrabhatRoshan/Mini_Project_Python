### We have to predict a number between a certain range entered by the user. The number guessed is to be auto generated by the machine itself initially and then the user will get chances to guess the correct result. The number of chances a user gets is derived from the formula: 

                                                    Math.sqrt(upp_bound-low_bound+2).
